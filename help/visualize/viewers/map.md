# Map viewer

Map viewer shows geographic data on a map. It recognizes geographic data from your dataset or opens files in the geographic data display formats. You can overlay data from multiple files using layers.

## Add a map viewer

1. Go to **Tables** and expand the **Viewers** panel.
1. Locate the **Map Viewer** icon and click it.

When you add a map viewer to a dataset, it recognizes columns with geographic semantic types and converts rows to the points on a map. All data relevant to a data point is shown in a tooltip.

## Configuring a map viewer

To configure map, click the **Gear** icon on top of the viewer and use info panels on the **Context Pane**.
For example, you can:

* Color-code and size-code data points on map by choosing corresponding columns from the dropdown lists in **Color**and **Size**.
* When size coding data points, you can set the min and max values for displaying markers in **Marker Min Size** and **Marker Max Size**.
* Identify the trends or patterns of geographic data at a glance by setting **Render type** as `heat map` .

### Working with layers

By default, a map viewer has three layers showing a map, all data points, and selected data points separately. When added, a heatmap is also displayed as a separate layer. To add new data as a layer, drag and drop the corresponding file into a map viewer.

To work with layers, right-click the viewer and select **Extended UI**. A toolbar and a layers management panel appear. Use them to delete layers, toggle their visibility, and more.

For example:

* On a toolbar, you can:
  * Add a heatmap as a separate layer by clicking the **Build heatmap for data** icon.
  * Create a new table with selected data by clicking the **Export selected markers to new table** icon.
  * Select markers by area.
* On a layers management panel, you can:
  * Create a new table with layer content by clicking the **Export layer data to table** icon.

## Interaction with other viewers

A map viewer responds to data filters and rows selection.
