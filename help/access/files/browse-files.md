# Browse files

<!-- TODO: introduction -->

## File browser
Datagrok comes with a built-in file browser that lets you navigate and view all files uploaded by you, retrieved via configured file connectors, or shared with you by other users. 
Files and folders are displayed as a tree view, and you can open a file by double-clicking on it.

You can open the file browser from the left sidebar by clicking ![Open](/help/images/open-icon.png) > **Files**.

Double-clicking on a supported file format opens the file in the Datagrok UI. 
For other file formats, you are prompted to download the file.


## Datagrok user's home directory

Each Datagrok user has a home directory, which is accessible in the file browser under the name "Home". 
The home directory is a connection to a file hosting (Amazon S3) that is created automatically when a user signs up. 
You can use it to store files imported from your computer. 
To upload a file, open the home directory in the Datagrok UI and drag and drop the file into it.
